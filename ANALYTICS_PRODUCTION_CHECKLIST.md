# Analytics Production Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN=silentscribe.dev` is set
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production` is set
- [ ] Optional: `ANALYTICS_HEALTH_TOKEN` for health monitoring API

### Emergency Controls (keep unset unless needed)

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_ALL_ANALYTICS` - Emergency kill switch
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_SAFE_MODE` - Minimal tracking mode
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_FORM_TRACKING` - Disable form tracking
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_SCROLL_TRACKING` - Disable scroll tracking

## ✅ Production Safety Features

### Rate Limiting & Throttling

- [x] Form interactions: Max 10 events/minute per form
- [x] Scroll tracking: Max 8 events/minute
- [x] Plausible calls: Max 15 events/minute total
- [x] Progressive throttling: 1-3 second delays

### Error Handling & Recovery

- [x] Circuit breaker pattern (opens after 10 errors/minute)
- [x] Auto-recovery attempts every 5 minutes
- [x] Silent error handling (no console errors in production)
- [x] Graceful degradation (forms work even if analytics fails)

### Performance Safeguards

- [x] Analytics only loads in production environment
- [x] All tracking calls are non-blocking
- [x] Failed analytics calls don't break site functionality
- [x] Memory leak prevention with cleanup functions

## ✅ Monitoring & Debugging

### Health Monitoring

- [x] Real-time health reports via `/api/analytics/health`
- [x] Success rate tracking (alerts if <80%)
- [x] Circuit breaker status monitoring
- [x] Error logging with automatic cleanup

### Production Controls

- [x] Feature flags for granular control
- [x] Safe mode for emergency situations
- [x] Debug mode available when needed
- [x] Performance impact monitoring

## ✅ Rollback Plan

If analytics causes issues in production:

1. **Immediate**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_ALL_ANALYTICS=true`
2. **Partial**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_SAFE_MODE=true`
3. **Granular**: Disable specific features:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_FORM_TRACKING=true`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_SCROLL_TRACKING=true`

## ✅ Testing Verification

### Pre-Deployment Tests

- [ ] Form submission works without console errors
- [ ] Page navigation is smooth and fast
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in production build
- [ ] Analytics health endpoint responds correctly

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

- [ ] Check `/api/analytics/health` after 15 minutes
- [ ] Verify no increase in JavaScript errors
- [ ] Confirm form conversion rates are normal
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals for performance impact

## ✅ Expected Behavior

### Development Environment

- ❌ Plausible script NOT loaded
- ❌ No analytics API calls made
- ✅ Forms work normally
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Debug logs show "Analytics disabled"

### Production Environment

- ✅ Plausible script loads safely
- ✅ Analytics tracking works with rate limits
- ✅ Forms work even if analytics fails
- ✅ Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures
- ✅ Silent error handling (no user-visible errors)

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

- JavaScript errors in browser console
- Form submissions failing or hanging
- Increased page load times
- Analytics health API showing <80% success rate
- Circuit breaker status = "open"

## 📞 Emergency Contacts

If issues occur, immediately set emergency environment variables and contact your team.
